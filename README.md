# Learn Git Branching

## Requirements

Without editing the files (only use git branch, git rebase, etc.), make the required changes to your fork of the assignment repository. You will be using and rearranging the 6 commits in the master branch to complete the exercises.

## Tasks

1. Create a branch called exercise-1. The contents of the branch should be index.html with only the boilerplate code and the heading.

2. Create a branch called exercise-2. The contents of the branch should be index.html with only the boilerplate code and the anchor tag.

3. Create a branch called exercise-3. The contents of the branch should be index.html with all of the content from master, as well as an \<h2> with your name below the \<h1>. The commit containing your name should appear in history immediately after the commit adding the \<h1>.

4. Create a branch called exercise-4. The contents of the branch should be index.html with all of the content from master, except the paragraph of text should be removed from the page without being removed from the branch's history.

5. Publish your exercise-3 to GitHub Pages.
